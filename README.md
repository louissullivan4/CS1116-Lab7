Hi. This is a database website for my scout group in Waterford.

Features include:
  -login/logout programs (Username and Password: sorry email me if you want it sullivanlouis0@gmail.com)
  -Display all the youth members on tables in different sections.
  -Add and Delete youth members. They are auto allocated to a section based on the age of the youth member. e.g Beavers are 5 to 7 year olds.
  -Adventure Skill updates for youth members (badges) and their Subscriptions Fees to the group is done in 4 terms.
  -Has three databases, youth members, leaders and the skills.
  -Add and delete leaders. This includes a garda vetting date.

I suppose the idea is to make something usable for my group on their phones or laptops rather than random pieces of paper around the hall. I hope to actually implement this database on my own
web sever in the future (with the right permission of course). Enjoy!
